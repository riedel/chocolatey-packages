### About
SWYH was developed by Sebastien Warin (http://sebastien.warin.fr) who currently lives in Lille (France). The first version of this project has been developed in July 2012 and published in October 2012.

Since June 2015, I decided to release the source code of SWYH to enable everyone to understand, diagnose, fix and improve this great application.
